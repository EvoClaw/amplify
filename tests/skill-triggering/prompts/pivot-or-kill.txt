# Expected skill: pivot-or-kill
# Expected behavior: Agent summarizes 3 failures honestly, analyzes root cause,
#   presents exactly 3 options (pivot/downgrade/kill), waits for user decision.
#   Should NOT attempt a 4th fix or downplay failures.

We've tried three different approaches and none of them outperform the baseline.
The attention mechanism doesn't help, the contrastive loss doesn't help, and
the data augmentation strategy doesn't help either. What should we do?
